# unix-v7-galileo
A UNIX v7/x86 distribution for the Intel Galileo based on Robert Nordier's x86 port. 

## Planned Tasks
It would be great to get as much of the Galileo hardware working in v7 UNIX as possible, but this is obviously quite a long term challenge.  But some of these include:

* TCP/IP networking (from BSD NET)
* GPIO
* Modernization
    * More modern shell
    * shutdown commands
    * Modern df output
    * 'which'
    * Some kind of LISP
